leetcode-explained
==================

The idea of this project is to create a collaborative workspace with explained, heavily commented, efficient solutions to the problem set found on leetcode.com. Where people can come and: 

- Learn how to solve a particular problem, thanks to the solution explained on the header, and understand what the code is doing, thanks to the comments placed through the file.

- Upload solutions to problems not yet solved. When doing so, please remember to describe your solution on the header of the file and place meaningful comments through your code. You can see this project as a challenge to explain your solutions rather than a challenge to solve the problems.

- Suggest improvements, including, but not limited to, more efficient solutions, clearer explanations, cleaner code and typo corrections. 


Software development is both science and art, commenting your code is an important step into making maintainable systems, and efficient code is an important step into making them faster and more scalable. Hopefully this project will help me and others be better software developers.
